# Calculator (JS)

This is a personal project.
I tried to recreate something similar to the iPhone's calculator app.<br>
The basic functions are available. <br>
I added a history system as well to keep track of your inputs in the calculator.
<br>
<!-- ðŸš§ I am still working on it, trying to improve especially the negative numbers system and the calculations including it. -->
